Displays a table of Doctor Who episodes since 2005, with title, season, and featured Doctor (lead protagonist). Users can select individual episodes to submit a rating (out of 10) and optional comment in a form. Agreggate ratings are then displayed. Users can also utilize the search bar to filter the table if they are looking for a specific episode. 

Additional to do:

1. "Fear Her" seems to appear twice on the table - need to fix the SQL?
2. Add breakpoint for desktop so that About boxes are side by side instead of stacked
3. Round the ratings to 2 decimal places...lol
